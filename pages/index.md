Hey, I am Abhisek Mallick, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston, with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. I hold a bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication, with internship experience in AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Analytics. My goal is to leverage my technical expertise to solve complex problems, drive data-driven decisions, and contribute to innovative solutions. With a strong foundation in analytics and a keen interest in continuous learning, I am eager to explore new challenges in the field of data science and analytics.

Outside of academics and work, I am an avid badminton player, having competed and won in inter-school and inter-college doubles tournaments. If you're around, feel free to reach out.
